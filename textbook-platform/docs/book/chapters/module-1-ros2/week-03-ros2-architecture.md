# ROS 2 Architecture

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a modern, flexible, and high-performance framework used for building robotic systems. This lesson explains the **core architecture of ROS 2**, how different components communicate, and how real-world robotic applications are structured using ROS 2.

This module is essential for understanding **how humanoid robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, and AI-powered robots are built and controlled**.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Understand what **ROS 2 is** and why it is used  
- Explain the **core components of ROS 2 architecture**  
- Understand **nodes, topics, services, and actions**  
- Describe the role of **DDS (Data Distribution Service)**  
- Understand the **ROS 2 communication model**

---

## Prerequisites

- Completed Week 1: Introduction to Physical AI
- Completed Week 2: Fundamentals of Humanoid Robotics
- Basic understanding of software architecture and communication patterns
- Familiarity with robotics terminology (sensors, actuators, nodes)
- Python 3.8+ or C++ knowledge (optional but helpful)
- Linux or Windows development environment

---

## 1. What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is an **open-source robotic middleware framework** that helps developers build, control, and simulate robots easily.

It acts as a **bridge between hardware and software**, allowing different robot components to communicate efficiently.

### Key Uses of ROS 2:
- Robot control
- Sensor data processing
- Autonomous navigation
- Computer vision
- AI-powered robotics
- Simulation with Gazebo

---

## 2. Core ROS 2 Architecture Overview

ROS 2 follows a **distributed architecture**, meaning:

- There is **no single central master**
- Each component runs independently
- Communication happens **peer-to-peer**
- Highly **scalable and fault tolerant**

### Main Architectural Layers:

1. Application Layer (Robot Programs)
2. ROS 2 Client Libraries (Python, C++)
3. ROS 2 Middleware (DDS)
4. Operating System (Linux/Windows)
5. Hardware Layer (Sensors, Motors, Cameras)

---

## 3. Nodes in ROS 2

A **node** is a **small independent program** that performs one specific task.

### Examples of ROS 2 Nodes:
- Camera node → Publishes images  
- Motor node → Controls wheel movement  
- Lidar node → Publishes distance data  
- AI node → Performs object detection  

✅ Each robot system contains **multiple nodes running together**.

---

## 4. Topics (Publish–Subscribe Model)

Topics allow **asynchronous communication** between nodes.

- A **publisher** sends data  
- A **subscriber** receives data  
- Data flows continuously in real-time  

### Example:
- Camera Node → Publishes image data on `/camera/image`
- Vision Node → Subscribes to `/camera/image`

✅ Used for:
- Sensor data streaming
- Real-time telemetry
- Continuous robot feedback

---

## 🔁 5. Services (Request–Response Model)

Services allow **two-way communication**.

- Client sends a **request**
- Server sends a **response**

### Example:
- Turn on motor
- Reset robot position
- Start scanning

✅ Used for **short, instant commands**

---

## ⏳ 6. Actions (Long-Running Tasks)

Actions are used for **long-running tasks with continuous feedback**.

### Example:
- Navigate to a location
- Pick an object
- Walk to a target

Actions provide:
- Feedback
- Result
- Cancel option

---

## 7. DDS (Data Distribution Service)

ROS 2 uses **DDS as its communication backbone**.

### DDS Provides:
- Real-time communication
- High reliability
- Secure data transfer
- Auto-discovery of nodes
- Quality of Service (QoS) control

✅ This is a **major upgrade from ROS 1**, which used a central master.

---

## 🔐 8. Security in ROS 2

ROS 2 includes built-in **security features**, which were missing in ROS 1:

- 🔐 Encrypted communication
- 👤 Node authentication
- Permission-based access control

This makes ROS 2 suitable for:
- Military robots  
- Medical robots  
- Industrial automation  
- Autonomous vehicles  

---

## 9. ROS 1 vs ROS 2 (Quick Comparison)

| Feature | ROS 1 | ROS 2 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Master Node | Required | ❌ Not required |
| Security | ❌ No | ✅ Built-in |
| Real-time Support | ❌ Poor | ✅ Excellent |
| Middleware | Custom | ✅ DDS |
| Windows Support | ❌ Limited | ✅ Full |
| Multi-Robot Systems | ❌ Weak | ✅ Strong |
