# 🤖 Week 2: Fundamentals of Humanoid Robotics

This week focuses on building a **strong foundational understanding of humanoid robotics**. Students will learn how humanoid robots are mechanically structured, how they move using actuators, how they sense the environment using sensors, and how different control layers work together to perform intelligent tasks. This week also covers important **design trade-offs** that engineers face while building humanoid robots.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:

- ✅ Understand the **mechanical structure** of humanoid robots  
- ✅ Explain **Degrees of Freedom (DOF)** in humanoid joints  
- ✅ Identify and compare **actuator types** such as servo motors and linear actuators  
- ✅ Understand different **sensor arrays** used in humanoid robots  
- ✅ Describe **control hierarchies** (low-level, mid-level, high-level)  
- ✅ Analyze **design trade-offs** in humanoid robot development

## 🦿 1. Mechanical Structure of Humanoid Robots

Humanoid robots are designed to resemble the **human body structure**. Their mechanical structure is divided into the following main parts:

- **Head:** Contains cameras, microphones, and sometimes a display face  
- **Torso:** Houses the power system, main computer, and battery  
- **Arms:** Used for manipulation, grabbing, and interaction  
- **Legs:** Responsible for walking, balance, and posture  
- **Hands & Feet:** Fine motor control and stable movement  

Each body part is connected using **joints**, allowing movement similar to human motion.

---

## 🔢 2. Degrees of Freedom (DOF)

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)** define how many independent movements a robot joint or body part can perform.

Examples:
- Shoulder joint → 3 DOF (up-down, forward-backward, rotation)
- Elbow → 1 DOF (bend)
- Wrist → 2 DOF (rotate + tilt)
- Hip → 3 DOF
- Knee → 1 DOF
- Ankle → 2 DOF

👉 More DOF = more flexibility  
👉 Fewer DOF = simpler and cheaper design  

High-end humanoid robots typically have **20–40 DOF**.

## ⚙️ 3. Actuator Types in Humanoid Robots

Actuators are the **muscles of robots**. They convert electrical energy into physical movement.

### 🔹 1. Servo Motors
- Most commonly used in humanoid robots
- Provide **precise angle control**
- Used in arms, knees, neck, and fingers
- Easy to control using Arduino or Raspberry Pi

✅ Advantages:
- Cheap
- Easy to program
- Lightweight

❌ Disadvantages:
- Limited strength
- Not suitable for heavy lifting

---

### 🔹 2. Linear Actuators
- Move in a **straight line (push & pull)**
- Used for lifting, pushing, and sliding motion

✅ Advantages:
- Strong force output
- Durable

❌ Disadvantages:
- Slower than servos
- Bulkier in size

## 👁️ 4. Sensor Arrays in Humanoid Platforms

Sensors allow robots to **“feel”, “see”, and “hear”** their environment.

### Common Sensors Used:

- 🎥 **Camera Sensors:** Vision and object recognition  
- 🧭 **IMU (Gyroscope + Accelerometer):** Balance & orientation  
- 🔊 **Microphones:** Voice input  
- 👣 **Force Sensors:** Foot pressure sensing  
- 🌡️ **Temperature Sensors:** Heat monitoring  
- 🚧 **Ultrasonic / LiDAR:** Obstacle detection  

These sensors work together as a **sensor array** to provide real-time environmental awareness.

## 🧠 5. Control Hierarchies in Humanoid Robots

Humanoid robots use **layered control systems** for smooth operation.

### 🟢 Low-Level Control
- Controls motors and joint movements directly
- Handles:
  - Motor speed
  - Torque
  - Joint position

Example: Servo angle control.

---

### 🟡 Mid-Level Control
- Handles **motion planning**
- Controls:
  - Walking patterns
  - Arm movement trajectories
  - Balance adjustments

Example: Gait control for walking.

---

### 🔴 High-Level Control
- Handles **decision making & AI**
- Controls:
  - Vision processing
  - Speech recognition
  - Task planning
  - Human-robot interaction

Example: Telling the robot to "walk to the table and pick the cup".

## ⚖️ 6. Design Trade-Offs in Humanoid Robots

Engineers must balance multiple factors while designing humanoid robots:

| Trade-Off Factor | Explanation |
|------------------|-------------|
| ⚡ Power vs Weight | More power means heavier batteries |
| 💰 Cost vs Performance | High performance increases cost |
| 🦾 Strength vs Speed | Strong robots move slower |
| 🧠 Intelligence vs Processing | Smarter robots need powerful CPUs |
| 🤖 Stability vs Flexibility | More joints increase instability |

Choosing the right balance depends on the **robot’s purpose** (education, healthcare, industry, research).
