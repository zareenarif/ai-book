# Conversational AI

Conversational AI enables robots and systems to **understand, process, and respond to natural language**. By combining **speech recognition, natural language understanding, and dialogue management**, robots can interact with humans **intelligently and naturally**.

This lesson introduces **the fundamentals, architecture, and ROS 2 integration** of Conversational AI in robotics.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Understand what **Conversational AI** is  
- Explain **speech-to-text and text-to-speech systems**  
- Understand **Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Dialogue Management**  
- Integrate Conversational AI with **ROS 2 Humble**  
- Enable humanoid robots to **receive and respond to verbal instructions**  
- Implement simple voice-controlled tasks in **simulation or real robots**  
- Understand the use of **AI and ML models** for human–robot interaction  

---

## Prerequisites

- Completed Week 1-8: ROS 2, simulation, and sensor fundamentals
- Completed Week 9: Vision-Language-Action Models
- Python 3.8+ with speech recognition libraries
- Basic understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Familiarity with audio processing and speech APIs
- ROS 2 Humble workspace configured
- Microphone and audio output device for testing

---

## 1. What is Conversational AI?

Conversational AI is a technology that allows robots to:

- Listen and understand human speech  
- Process instructions or queries  
- Respond intelligently  
- Engage in multi-turn conversations  

✅ Example:
- Human: “Bring me the red cube.”  
- Robot: Detects red cube → Grasps → Moves to human → Confirms: “Here is the red cube.”

---

## 2. Importance of Conversational AI in Robotics

Conversational AI enables:

- Hands-free robot control  
- Human–robot interaction (HRI)  
- Smart assistants and service robots  
- Accessibility for disabled users  
- Multi-modal AI integration (vision + language + action)  

✅ Humanoid and service robots rely heavily on conversational AI for **effective interaction**.

---

## 3. Architecture of Conversational AI

### 1. Speech Recognition
- Converts spoken language into text  
- Examples: Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper  

### 2. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
- Parses text into structured data  
- Identifies **intents** and **entities**  

### 3. Dialogue Management
- Determines **appropriate responses or actions**  
- Can be rule-based or AI-based  

### 4. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Converts robot response text into speech  
- Examples: Google TTS, Amazon Polly  

✅ End-to-end workflow:  
**Human speech → ASR → NLU → Dialogue Manager → TTS → Robot speech/action**

---

## 4. ROS 2 Integration

Conversational AI can be integrated with ROS 2 using:

- ROS 2 topics:
  - `/voice_input` → Publishes user speech
  - `/voice_output` → Robot’s speech
  - `/robot_cmd` → Commands for motion  
- ROS 2 nodes:
  - ASR Node (speech recognition)
  - NLU Node (intent parsing)
  - Action Node (robot motion execution)
  - TTS Node (robot response)

✅ Enables **real-time human–robot interaction**.

---

## 5. Practical Examples

### Example 1: Voice-Controlled Robot
- Human: “Move forward 1 meter”
- ASR converts speech to text
- NLU identifies intent: move
- Action node executes `/cmd_vel` command
- Robot moves forward

### Example 2: Query-Based Assistance
- Human: “Where is the red cube?”  
- Robot uses camera vision + NLP to answer  
- Robot responds: “The red cube is on the table”

### Example 3: Multi-Turn Conversation
- Human: “Pick up the cube” → Robot: “Which cube?”  
- Human: “The red one” → Robot executes action  

---
