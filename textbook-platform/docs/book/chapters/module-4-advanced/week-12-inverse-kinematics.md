# 🤖 Inverse Kinematics (IK)

Inverse Kinematics (IK) is a fundamental concept in robotics that allows a robot to **compute the required joint angles** to achieve a desired **end-effector position and orientation**. It is widely used in **humanoid robots, manipulators, and autonomous robotic arms** for precise motion control.

This lesson introduces **IK principles, mathematical formulations, ROS 2 integration, and practical applications**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- ✅ Understand what **Inverse Kinematics** is  
- ✅ Differentiate between **Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics**  
- ✅ Solve IK for simple manipulators  
- ✅ Apply IK in **humanoid robot limbs**  
- ✅ Integrate IK with **ROS 2 Humble** for motion planning  
- ✅ Use simulation environments like **Gazebo, Unity, or Isaac Sim** to test IK  
- ✅ Understand challenges like **singularities and redundancy**

## 🧠 1. What is Inverse Kinematics?

Inverse Kinematics is the process of:

- Finding **joint angles (θ1, θ2, …, θn)**  
- That result in a desired **end-effector position and orientation** (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw)  

✅ Example:
- Desired position: `(x=0.5, y=0.2, z=0.3)`  
- IK computes: `Joint1=30°, Joint2=45°, Joint3=10°`  
- Robot moves its arm to reach that position

## 🔹 2. Forward Kinematics vs Inverse Kinematics

| Feature                | Forward Kinematics (FK)           | Inverse Kinematics (IK)           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Input                  | Joint angles                    | End-effector pose               |
| Output                 | End-effector pose               | Joint angles                     |
| Computation            | Direct, simple                  | Requires solving equations      |
| Use                    | Simulation, animation            | Motion planning, manipulation  |

✅ IK is **more complex but essential for task-oriented motion**.

## 🏗️ 3. IK Mathematical Formulation

For a robot arm with `n` joints:

1. **Forward Kinematics:**
\[
T = f(\theta_1, \theta_2, ..., \theta_n)
\]

2. **Inverse Kinematics:**
\[
\theta_1, \theta_2, ..., \theta_n = f^{-1}(x, y, z, \phi, \theta, \psi)
\]

Where:
- \(T\) = end-effector pose  
- \(\theta_i\) = joint angles  
- \(x, y, z\) = position  
- \(\phi, \theta, \psi\) = orientation  

✅ IK often requires **numerical methods** due to non-linear equations.
